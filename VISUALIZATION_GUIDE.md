## 📈 Understanding the Data

### Vulnerability Counts
- **Total**: 4,675 vulnerabilities across all projects
- **Unique Packages**: 694 different vulnerable packages
- **Unique CVEs**: Hundreds of distinct vulnerability identifiers

### Risk Scoring
```
Risk Score = Number of Vulnerabilities × Number of Projects Affected

Example:
- Package A: 50 vulns × 5 projects = 250 risk score
- Package B: 10 vulns × 20 projects = 200 risk score
→ Package A is higher risk despite B affecting more projects
```

### Health Scoring
```
Health Score = (Clean Projects / Total Projects) × 100%

Example Category with 20 projects:
- 15 clean, 5 vulnerable = 75% health score
- Higher is better!
```

### Severity Levels

| Severity | CVSS Range | Action Required |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| 🔴 Critical | 9.0-10.0 | Immediate fix |
| 🟠 High | 7.0-8.9 | Priority fix |
| 🟡 Medium | 4.0-6.9 | Scheduled fix |
| 🟢 Low | 0.1-3.9 | Monitor |
| ⚪ Negligible | 0.0 | Informational |

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Visualizations

1. **Edit `main.js`**: Add new rendering functions
2. **Edit `index.html`**: Add new chart containers
3. **Edit `style.css`**: Style new elements
4. **Rebuild**: `npm run build`

### Modifying Colors

Edit CSS variables in `style.css`:
```css
:root {
  --primary: #6366f1;      /* Main brand color */
  --danger: #ef4444;       /* Vulnerability color */
  --success: #10b981;      /* Clean/safe color */
  --warning: #f59e0b;      /* Medium severity */
  /* ... etc */
}
```

### Updating Data

Re-run the analysis script:
```bash
cd /path/to/2023-oss-in-energy-data
python3 analyze_vulnerabilities.py
```

This regenerates `vulnerability-data.json` with fresh data.

   python3 scan_vulnerabilities.py
   ```

3. **Analyze data**:
   ```bash
   python3 analyze_vulnerabilities.py
   ```

4. **Refresh dashboard**:
   - Development: Changes auto-reload
   - Production: Rebuild with `npm run build`

- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Data Loading Issues?
- Verify JSON file path in `main.js`
- Check file permissions
- Ensure JSON is valid (use JSONLint)

### Performance Issues?
- Reduce bubble chart data points (edit limits in `main.js`)
- Disable animations in CSS
- Use production build instead of dev

### Mobile Display Issues?
- Test on real devices, not just browser dev tools
- Check viewport meta tag in `index.html`
- Verify touch events work properly
