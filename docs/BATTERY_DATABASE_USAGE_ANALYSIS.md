---

## 5. RISK ASSESSMENT

### 1. DATA INTEGRITY RISK: **HIGH**

**Impact:** Battery safety calculations compromised

**Attack Scenarios:**
- Attacker modifies battery capacity data → EV range estimates are wrong
- Thermal runaway thresholds altered → safety models fail
- Chemical composition data corrupted → research results invalid
- Historical performance data manipulated → trend analysis flawed

**Downstream Effects:**
- **Academic:** Published research becomes unreproducible
- **Commercial:** EV battery packs designed with bad data
- **Safety:** Incorrect fire risk assessments for grid storage

**Estimated Impact:** ~950 users relying on potentially compromised data

---

### 2. CONFIDENTIALITY RISK: **MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Impact:** Proprietary battery formulations stolen

**Attack Scenarios:**
- **SQL Injection (27 vectors):** Extract entire database
  ```sql
  -- Example: Steal all battery formulations
  SELECT * FROM battery_materials WHERE proprietary=true
  ```
- **Admin Account Compromise:** Access to unpublished research data
- **Path Traversal:** Download configuration files, API keys

**Sensitive Data at Risk:**
- Novel electrolyte compositions
- Proprietary anode/cathode materials
- Unpublished performance benchmarks
- Manufacturing process parameters
- Competitive intelligence on next-gen batteries

**Economic Impact:**
- Battery IP worth millions in R&D investment
- Competitive advantage for adversaries
- Patent filing sabotage

---

### 3. AVAILABILITY RISK: **HIGH**

**Impact:** Research workflows disrupted

**Attack Scenarios:**
- **DoS via Multipart Upload:** Overwhelm server with malicious requests
- **Image Processing DoS:** Upload decompression bombs via Pillow CVEs
- **Database Query DoS:** Trigger resource exhaustion through complex queries

**Disruption Scenarios:**
- PhD student loses access during dissertation deadline
- Battery safety analysis delayed for product launch
- Grid storage project proposal misses funding deadline
- Collaborative research stalled across institutions

**Productivity Loss:**
- ~950 users × 2 hours/week = **1,900 user-hours/week** at risk
- Annual productivity value: ~$500K (assuming $50/hour research time)

---

## 6. DOWNSTREAM IMPACT ANALYSIS

### If Battery Safety Models Are Compromised

#### Electric Vehicles (EVs)
**Risk:** Incorrect battery pack designs
**Impact:**
- Thermal runaway risk miscalculation
- Fire safety margins compromised
- Warranty cost underestimation
- Recall potential for deployed vehicles

**Example:** If 10% of universal-battery-database users are EV manufacturers, and each influences 1,000 vehicles/year, that's **~2,000 vehicles** potentially affected by compromised data.

---

#### Grid-Scale Energy Storage
**Risk:** Incorrect capacity/degradation models
**Impact:**
- Grid stability issues (frequency regulation failures)
- Fire risk in large battery installations
- Economic losses from premature battery replacement
- Renewable energy integration delays

**Example:** A single grid storage facility stores 100+ MWh. Compromised safety data could affect multi-million dollar installations.

---

#### Consumer Electronics
**Risk:** Battery safety in phones, laptops, power banks
**Impact:**
- Lithium-ion battery fires
- Product recalls (millions of units)
- Brand reputation damage
- Regulatory penalties

---

#### Academic Research
**Risk:** Reproducibility crisis in battery science
**Impact:**
- Publications based on corrupted data
- Peer review failures
- Grant funding wasted on invalid research
- Scientific community trust erosion

**Statistics:**
- If 40% of users (380 people) are researchers
- Average 2 papers/year using the database
- That's **760 publications/year** potentially affected

## 7. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: BATTERY PROJECTS IN DATASET

| Rank | Project | Stars | CVEs | Risk Level |
|------|---------|-------|------|------------|
| 1 | **universal-battery-database** | **95** | **365** | **CRITICAL** |
| 2 | pyBAMM | 245 | 187 | HIGH |
| 3 | battery-data-toolkit | 34 | 125 | MEDIUM |
| 4 | liionpack | 42 | 89 | MEDIUM |

**Key Insight:** universal-battery-database has the **HIGHEST CVE count** among battery-focused projects in the energy sector dataset, despite moderate popularity.

**Why This Matters:**
- More visible projects (higher stars) often get more security scrutiny
- universal-battery-database's moderate visibility + high CVE count = **underestimated risk**
- Users may assume "95 stars = trustworthy" without checking security
