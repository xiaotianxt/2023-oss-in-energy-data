# CVE Scanning and Recursive Dependency Analysis

This document describes the new features added to the dependency analyzer for CVE detection and recursive dependency resolution.

## Overview

The dependency analyzer has been enhanced with three major new capabilities:

1. **CVE Scanning** - Detect known vulnerabilities in packages using the OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities) database
2. **Recursive Dependency Resolution** - Explore transitive dependencies (dependencies of dependencies)
3. **Impact Analysis** - Understand which projects are affected by CVEs in their dependency chain

## New Modules

### 1. `cve_scanner.py` - CVE Detection

Scans packages for known vulnerabilities using the OSV API, which aggregates CVE data from multiple sources.

**Key Features:**
- Scans PyPI, npm, Maven, Go, and Rust packages
- Caches CVE data to reduce API calls
- Stores results in new database tables:
  - `package_cves` - CVE information for each package
  - `project_cve_impact` - Links CVEs to affected projects

**Usage:**
```python
from cve_scanner import CVEScanner

scanner = CVEScanner()

# Scan a single package
cves = scanner.scan_package('requests', 'pypi')

# Scan all dependencies in database
results = scanner.scan_all_dependencies()

# Get CVE summary
summary = scanner.get_cve_summary()
```

**CLI Commands:**
```bash
# Scan all dependencies for CVEs
python cli.py scan-cves

# Force refresh cached data
python cli.py scan-cves --force-refresh
```

### 2. `dependency_resolver.py` - Recursive Dependencies

Resolves transitive dependencies by querying package registries (PyPI, npm, etc.) to build a complete dependency tree.

**Key Features:**
- Recursively resolves dependencies up to a configurable depth
- Supports PyPI and npm (Maven and Go stubs included)
- Stores transitive relationships in `transitive_dependencies` table
- Performs reverse lookups to find packages affected by a dependency

**Usage:**
```python
from dependency_resolver import DependencyResolver

resolver = DependencyResolver(max_depth=3)

# Resolve dependencies recursively
dep_tree = resolver.resolve_recursive('requests', 'pypi')

# Get all transitive dependencies for a package
all_deps = resolver.get_all_transitive_dependencies('requests', 'pypi')

# Find packages that depend on a specific package (reverse lookup)
affected = resolver.find_packages_affected_by_dependency('urllib3', 'pypi')
```

**CLI Commands:**
```bash
# Resolve dependencies for a specific package
python cli.py resolve requests pypi

# With custom depth
python cli.py resolve express npm --max-depth 5
```

### 3. `impact_analyzer.py` - Combined Impact Analysis

Combines CVE scanning with dependency resolution to provide comprehensive vulnerability impact analysis.

**Key Features:**
- Analyzes both direct and transitive dependencies
- Identifies dependency paths for vulnerabilities
- Calculates severity breakdowns
- Identifies high-risk dependencies
- Performs reverse CVE impact analysis (find all projects affected by a CVE)

**Usage:**
```python
from impact_analyzer import ImpactAnalyzer

analyzer = ImpactAnalyzer(max_depth=2)

# Analyze a specific project
report = analyzer.analyze_project_full_impact(
    project_id=1,
    resolve_transitive=True,
    scan_cves=True
)

# Analyze all projects
results = analyzer.analyze_all_projects()

# Find projects affected by a specific CVE
impact = analyzer.find_cve_downstream_impact('CVE-2023-1234')

# Export vulnerability report
analyzer.export_report(Path('vulnerabilities.json'), format='json')
```

**CLI Commands:**
```bash
# Analyze a specific project
python cli.py impact --project-id 1

# Analyze with custom options
python cli.py impact --project-id 1 --max-depth 3 --output report.json

# Analyze all projects
python cli.py impact

# Find projects affected by a specific CVE
python cli.py cve-impact CVE-2023-1234

# Export all vulnerabilities
python cli.py export-vulnerabilities --output vulnerabilities.csv --format csv
```

## Database Schema Changes

New tables added to `dependencies.db`:

### `package_cves`
Stores CVE information for packages:
- `package_name` - Name of the package
- `ecosystem` - Package ecosystem (pypi, npm, etc.)
- `cve_id` - CVE or OSV identifier
- `severity` - Severity level (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- `cvss_score` - CVSS score if available
- `description` - Vulnerability description
- `published_date` - When the CVE was published
- `affected_versions` - JSON array of affected versions
- `patched_versions` - JSON array of patched versions
- `references` - JSON array of reference URLs
- `checked_at` - When this was last checked

### `transitive_dependencies`
Stores recursive dependency relationships:
- `package_name` - Root package name
- `ecosystem` - Root package ecosystem
- `version_spec` - Version specifier
- `depends_on_package` - Name of dependency
- `depends_on_ecosystem` - Ecosystem of dependency
- `depends_on_version` - Version of dependency
- `dependency_depth` - How deep in the tree (1 = direct)
- `resolved_at` - When this was resolved

### `project_cve_impact`
Links projects to CVEs affecting them:
- `project_id` - Project ID
- `cve_id` - CVE identifier
- `affected_package` - Package with the vulnerability
- `ecosystem` - Package ecosystem
- `is_direct_dependency` - Whether this is a direct dependency
- `dependency_path` - Path from project to vulnerable package
- `severity` - CVE severity
- `cvss_score` - CVSS score
- `detected_at` - When this was detected

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Complete Security Audit

```bash
# 1. Scan all dependencies for CVEs
python cli.py scan-cves

# 2. Analyze impact on all projects
python cli.py impact --output security_audit.json

# 3. Export detailed vulnerability report
python cli.py export-vulnerabilities --output vulnerabilities.csv --format csv
```

### Example 2: Investigate a Specific Project

```bash
# 1. Find the project ID
python cli.py stats

# 2. Analyze the project with transitive dependencies
python cli.py impact --project-id 42 --max-depth 3 --output project_42_report.json

# 3. Review the JSON report for vulnerability details
```

### Example 3: Investigate a Specific CVE

```bash
# 1. Find all projects affected by a CVE
python cli.py cve-impact CVE-2023-45853

# This will show:
# - Which package has the vulnerability
# - All projects using that package
# - Whether it's a direct or transitive dependency
# - The dependency path
```

### Example 4: Explore Dependency Tree

```bash
# Resolve and visualize dependency tree for a package
python cli.py resolve requests pypi --max-depth 3

# Output will show:
# ðŸ“¦ requests (pypi) >=2.0.0
#   â”œâ”€ urllib3 (pypi) ^1.26.0
#     â”œâ”€ certifi (pypi) >=2020.0.0
#     â””â”€ idna (pypi) >=2.5
#   â”œâ”€ charset-normalizer (pypi) ~2.0.0
#   â””â”€ certifi (pypi) >=2017.4.17
#     â†» certifi (already visited)
```

## API Integration

### OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities) API

The CVE scanner uses the OSV API which provides:
- Unified vulnerability database across ecosystems
- Free, no API key required
- High-quality data from multiple sources (CVE, GitHub Security Advisories, etc.)
- API documentation: https://osv.dev/

**Rate Limiting:**
- The OSV API has generous rate limits
- Results are cached for 24 hours by default
- Use `--force-refresh` to bypass cache

### Package Registry APIs

The dependency resolver uses official package registries:

**PyPI (Python):**
- API: `https://pypi.org/pypi/{package}/json`
- Returns package metadata including dependencies

**npm (JavaScript):**
- API: `https://registry.npmjs.org/{package}`
- Returns all versions and their dependencies

## Performance Considerations

### Scanning Speed
- CVE scanning: ~1-2 seconds per unique package (with caching)
- For 3,524 dependencies, expect ~1-2 hours for first scan
- Subsequent scans use cache and are much faster

### Dependency Resolution
- Network-intensive operation
- PyPI/npm APIs are generally fast (<1 second per package)
- Recursive resolution with depth=3 can generate many API calls
- Consider using `max_depth=2` for large projects

### Optimizations
- CVE data is cached for 24 hours
- Transitive dependencies are stored in database
- Only unique packages are scanned/resolved
- Concurrent processing where possible

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Rate limiting from package registries

**Solution:** Add delays or reduce `max_depth`:
```python
import time
resolver = DependencyResolver(max_depth=2)
time.sleep(0.5)  # Add delay between requests
```

### Issue: OSV API timeout

**Solution:** The scanner has built-in retry logic and timeout handling. If persistent:
```bash
python cli.py scan-cves --force-refresh
```

### Issue: Database locked errors

**Solution:** Ensure only one process is accessing the database at a time. SQLite doesn't handle concurrent writes well.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Parallel scanning** - Use threading/multiprocessing for faster CVE scans
2. **Maven/Go support** - Complete implementation for these ecosystems
3. **Version compatibility checking** - Determine if installed version is actually vulnerable
4. **Automated remediation suggestions** - Suggest version upgrades to fix CVEs
5. **Continuous monitoring** - Schedule regular scans and alert on new CVEs
6. **Integration with CI/CD** - Fail builds if high-severity CVEs found
7. **SBOM generation** - Export Software Bill of Materials in standard formats

## Contributing
