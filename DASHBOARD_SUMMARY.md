## 📊 5 Analytical Perspectives

### 1. 🌐 **Ecosystem View**
Understand the overall security landscape:
- **Severity Distribution**: Pie chart showing Critical/High/Medium/Low breakdown
- **Package Types**: See which ecosystems (Python, JS, Java) dominate
- **Language Analysis**: Bar chart of top 20 programming languages
- **Category Health**: Visual health scores for each energy sector

### 2. 📦 **Package Analysis**
Identify the most dangerous dependencies:
- **Interactive Bubble Chart**: 
  - Bubble size = number of vulnerabilities
  - Color intensity = projects impacted (blue → red)
  - Hover to see details!
- **Top 20 Risk Table**: Sortable list with risk scores

**Key Findings:**
- `universal-battery-database`: 894 vulnerabilities
- `tensorflow 2.1.0`: Affects multiple projects, 100+ vulns
- `pillow` older versions: High-severity image issues

### 3. 🚀 **Project Explorer**
Drill down into specific projects:
- **Real-time Search**: Find projects by name
- **Smart Filters**: By category, status (vulnerable/clean)
- **Bubble Visualization**: Projects sized by vulnerability count
- **Project Cards**: Detailed security information

**Use Cases:**
- Identify which of YOUR projects need attention
- Compare projects within a category
- Find the cleanest projects to learn from

### 4. 📊 **Category Insights**
Compare energy sectors:
- **Vulnerabilities by Category**: Which sectors are most vulnerable?
- **Project Distribution**: How many projects per category?
- **Comparison Matrix**: Average vulnerabilities per project

**Insights:**
- See which energy sectors (Solar, Grid, Wind, etc.) need help
- Identify patterns in vulnerability distribution
- Prioritize sector-wide security initiatives

### 5. 🕸️ **Dependency Network**
Understand risk propagation:
- **Force-Directed Graph**: Draggable nodes showing dependency relationships
- **Risk Scoring**: Node size = vulnerabilities × projects affected
- **Common CVEs**: Table of most widespread vulnerabilities
- **GitHub Links**: Click to view CVE details

**Use Cases:**
- Visualize "blast radius" of vulnerable packages
- Identify supply chain risks
- Find common vulnerabilities for bulk remediation
